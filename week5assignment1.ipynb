    "Ans-an exception is an error that occurs during the execution of a program. When a statement or expression encounters an exceptional condition, it raises an exception, which disrupts the normal flow of the program and transfers control to an exception handler.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions are a way of handling errors or exceptional situations in a program. They allow you to write code that can gracefully recover from errors and continue executing, rather than abruptly terminating the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax errors, on the other hand, are errors that occur when you violate the syntax rules of the Python language. They are typically detected by the Python interpreter before the program is executed. Syntax errors prevent the program from running at all and need to be fixed before the code can be executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the main differences between exceptions and syntax errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Occurrence: Exceptions occur during the execution of a program when a statement encounters an exceptional condition. Syntax errors occur before the program execution during the parsing phase when the Python interpreter detects a violation of the language syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Handling: Exceptions can be handled using try-except blocks, allowing you to catch and handle specific exceptions gracefully. Syntax errors cannot be handled in the same way since they prevent the program from running at all. Syntax errors must be fixed by correcting the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Impact: Exceptions disrupt the normal flow of the program and transfer control to an exception handler, allowing you to handle the error and continue the execution of the program. Syntax errors prevent the program from executing altogether, and the code needs to be corrected before it can run."
